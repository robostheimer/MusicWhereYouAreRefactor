# MusicWhereYouAre

Ever wonder what artists are from where you happen to be? I did, while driving to Minneapolis from Washington, DC. From this kernel of an idea, an app was born. MusicWhereYouAre will find songs by artists from where you happen to be at that moment. After the app has figured out Where You Are, it loads a Spotify playlists  that includes artists from your geolocation. MusicWhereYouAre is responsively designed web app. 

Currently in beta: available for using here: http://musicwhereyour.com
